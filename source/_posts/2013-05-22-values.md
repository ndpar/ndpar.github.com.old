Initially I named this page *Quotes* but then it overgrew to a collection of wise aphorisms, practical advises and maxima. I renamed it to *Values*.

{% blockquote René Descartes %}
De omnibus dubitandum.
{% endblockquote %}

"Doubt everything", René Descartes' personal motto.

{% blockquote Ovid %}
Bene vixit qui bene latuit.
{% endblockquote %}

"He lives well, who conceals himself well", another motto of René Descartes.

{% blockquote The Second Law of Thermodynamics %}
It is not possible to convert one form of energy to another with 100% efficiency.
{% endblockquote %}

I think it applies not only to thermodynamics but to practically everything.

{% blockquote William of Ockham %}
Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate.
{% endblockquote %}

"Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity", Occam's Razor. Binding it together with the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics I would say: Fight the entropy every day of your life.

{% blockquote Marcus Porcius Cato %}
I would much rather have men ask why I have no statue, than why I have one.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Howard H. Aiken %}
Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Albert Einstein %}
Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them.
{% endblockquote %}
