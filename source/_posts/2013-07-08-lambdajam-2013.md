## Prelude

This is my impressionistic non-canonical irregular Clojuresque-Erlangish notes on [Lambda Jam](http://lambdajam.com) conference which took place in Chicago on July 8–10, 2013.
These notes are pretty long, and I don't split them on purpose.
If you read them all, you should become overwhelmed and overloaded with the information.
Only this way you can feel the same I felt on the last day of the conference :)

## Stuart Sierra — Data, Visibility, and Abstraction

* Video: [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-visibility-abstraction)

### Quotes

* QBasic distinguished between subroutines and functions.
* Perl is a QBasic of Linux.
* Perl provided bunch of abstractions that made my life easier.
* Just a few generic data structures can represent pretty much any kind of data.

{% codeblock lang:perl %}
#!/usr/bin/env perl

my $user =
  { name  => "Stuart",
    age   => 15,
    langs => [ "BASIC",
               "C++",
               "Perl" ] };

print $user->{'langs'}[2];
{% endcodeblock %}

* `Tie::File` — Access the lines of a disk file via a Perl array.
* XSLT is a homoiconic programming language.
* [In XSLT] you can write the entire program as a series of data transformations.

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
saxon one.xslt site.xml t1.xml
saxon two.xslt t1.xml t2.xml
saxon three.xslt t2.xml t3.xml
saxon four.xslt t3.xml index.html
{% endcodeblock %}

* Clojure has universal data structures.

{% codeblock lang:clojure %}
(def user {:name "Stuart"
           :age 25
           :langs ["Lisp"
                   "Ruby"
                   "Clojure"]})
{% endcodeblock %}

* I'm frequently suspicious of libraries that use a lot of macros to create their abstractions because it means I can't see them, I can't manipulate them with the tools I already have.

{% codeblock lang:clojure %}
(require 'clojure.inspector)
(clojure.inspector/inspect-tree user)
{% endcodeblock %}

{% img center /images/posts/clojure.inspector.png %}

* I started to write my programs as a series of data transformations with just one set of side-effects at the very end.

{% codeblock lang:clojure %}
(defn gather-information [state]
  (assoc state :analysis
               (computation (:input state))))

(defn make-decision [state]
  (assoc state :response
               (if (condition? (:analysis state))
                   :launch-missile
                   :erase-hard-drive)))

(defn take-action [state]
  (case (:response state)
    :launch-missile (launch-missile)
    :erase-hard-drive (erase-hard-drive)))

(defn complex-process [initial-state]
  (-> initial-state
      gather-information
      make-decision
      take-action))
{% endcodeblock %}

* I try to pursue abstractions that make programs more visible, make easier to see what the program is doing.

{% blockquote Edsger W. Dijkstra %}
Being abstract is something profoundly different from being vague…

The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
{% endblockquote %}


## Aditya Siram — Simile-Free Monad Recipes

* Slides: [GitHub](https://github.com/strangeloop/lambdajam2013/blob/master/slides/Siram-SimileFreeMonadRecipes.pdf)

### Non-idiomatic Haskell monad tutorial

Working with monads is a switching between monadic and non-monadic context.

### IO

* `<-` operator gets the value from monadic context.
* `return` puts the value into monadic context.

{% codeblock lang:haskell %}
main :: IO ()
main = do
  writeFile "test.txt" "a,b,c,d,e" :: IO ()
  x :: String <- readFile "test.txt" :: IO String
  let upCased :: String = map toUpper x
  y :: String <- return upCased :: IO String
  print y :: IO ()
{% endcodeblock %}

### Reader

* Reader = Read-only State + Result
* `runReader` :: Reader Monad -> Read-Only State -> Result
* `ask` extracts the state from the monad for inspection.

### Writer

* Writer = Append-Only State + Result
* `runWriter` :: Writer Monad -> (Result, Accumulated State)
* State is accumulated using `tell`.

### State

* State Monad = Mutable State + Result
* `get`, `put` do what they sound like.
* `runState` :: State Monad -> Initial State -> (Result, New State)
* Initial State is required.


## Dean Wampler — Copious Data, the "Killer App" for FP

* Slides: [GitHub](https://github.com/strangeloop/lambdajam2013/blob/master/slides/Wampler-CopiousDataTheKillerAppForFP.pdf)
* Video: [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/big-data-functional-programming)

### Quotes

* It’s hard to implement many algorithms in MapReduce.
* MapReduce is very course-grained.
* For Hadoop in particularly, the Java API is hard to use.

* Hadoop is the EJBs of our time

{% codeblock lang:java %}
import org.apache.hadoop.io.*;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.*;
import java.util.*;

class WCMapper extends MapReduceBase
    implements Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {

    static final IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
    static final Text word = new Text(); // Value will be set in a non-thread-safe way!

    @Override
    public void map(LongWritable key, Text valueDocContents,
            OutputCollector<Text, IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) {
        String[] tokens = valueDocContents.toString().split("\\s+");
        for (String wordString: tokens) {
            if (wordString.length > 0) {
                word.set(wordString.toLowerCase());
                output.collect(word, one);
            }
        }
    }
}

class Reduce extends MapReduceBase
    implements Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {

    public void reduce(Text keyWord, Iterator<IntWritable> valuesCounts,
            OutputCollector<Text, IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) {
        int totalCount = 0;
        while (valuesCounts.hasNext()) {
            totalCount += valuesCounts.next().get();
        }
        output.collect(keyWord, new IntWritable(totalCount));
    }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

* Use Cascalog

{% codeblock lang:clojure %}
(defn lowercase [w] (.toLowerCase w))

(?<- (stdout) [?word ?count]
  (sentence ?s)
    (split ?s :> ?word1)
  (lowercase ?word1 :> ?word)
    (c/count ?count))
{% endcodeblock %}

* Use Spark

{% codeblock lang:scala %}
object WordCountSpark {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        val file = spark.textFile(args(0))
        val counts = file.flatMap(line => line.split("\\W+"))
                         .map(word => (word, 1))
                         .reduceByKey(_ + _)
        counts.saveAsTextFile(args(1))
    }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

* Data problems are fundamentally Mathematics!
* Data will drive widespread FP adoption.

## Jam

A jam is similar to a code retreat, only you work in groups instead of pairs. It starts with a problem description. Then you form a group and work on the problem for 3 hours. In the end you share your experience with the audience.

The problem of the first jam was Peter Norvig's [Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). I was wandering the room looking for an Erlang group to join when I bumped into this bunch of wonderful people: [Bruce Adams](https://twitter.com/Bruce_Adams), [Joe Armstrong](https://twitter.com/joeerl), [Garrett Smith](https://twitter.com/gar1t), [Bryan Hunter](https://twitter.com/bryan_hunter), and [Karl Grzeszczak](https://twitter.com/karl_grz).

{% img center https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BOrdEK6CYAA2zlb.jpg %}

Soon the jam transformed into an Erlang master class from Joe Armstrong. We were watching the master's work flow, his way of thinking, learning his tips and tricks, listening to his brilliant comments about Erlang and Haskell.

{% img center https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BOrk-wfCEAE3kKr.jpg %}

At some point I remarked how elegant was the function Joe Armstrong just implemented, on which he replied: ***There is not much intelligence here. It's all about practice.***

{% blockquote @karl_grz https://twitter.com/karl_grz/statuses/354386650291380224 %}
Today I watched @joeerl implementing a parallel spell checker in Erlang. That was worth the price of admission alone. Thank you! #LambdaJam

### Systems That Run Forever Self-Heal and Scale

* Slides: [GitHub](https://github.com/strangeloop/lambdajam2013/blob/master/slides/Armstrong-SystemsThatRunForever.pdf)
* Video: [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/self-heal-scalable-system)

### Quotes


* I'm not interested in programming languages. I'm interested in solving problems.
* Primary goal Erlang was designed for is the fault-talerant computation.
* I think it's a bad idea to design your system for 10 people and then scale it up for 10,000. It's better to design it for 10M and scale it down.
* The difficult part of making reliable system is to make multiple machines work independently in parallel.

Why distributed programming is hard

1. Difficulty in identifying and dealing with failures.
1. Achieving consistency in data across processes.
1. Heterogeneous nature of the components involved in the system.
1. Testing a distributed system is quite difficult.
1. The technologies involved in distributed systems are not easy to understand.

*Chord* algorithm: distributing data across several machines

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
S1 IP = 235.23.34.12
S2 IP = 223.23.141.53
S3 IP = 122.67.12.23

md5(ip(s1)) = C82D4DB065065DBDCDADFBC5A727208E
md5(ip(s2)) = 099340C20A42E004716233AB216761C3
md5(ip(s3)) = A0E607462A563C4D8CCDB8194E3DEC8B

Sorted:
099340C20A42E004716233AB216761C3 => s2
A0E607462A563C4D8CCDB8194E3DEC8B => s3
C82D4DB065065DBDCDADFBC5A727208E => s1

lookup Key = "mail-23412"
md5("mail-23412") => B91AF709D7C1E6988FCEE7ADF7094A26

So the Value is on machine s3 (first machine with Md5 lower than md5 of key)

Replica:
md5(md5("mail-23412")) => D604E7A54DC18FD7AC70D12468C34B63

So the replica is on machine s1
{% endcodeblock %}


* What if master dies? *Paxos* — distributed leadership election algorithm. Very complicated algorithm that only few people understand.
* The leadership election is solved in OTP (mnesia, gen_leader) and Riak.
* You don't need libraries to write web server. Any fool can write them. But distributed data storage is difficult.

Six rules for building HA systems

1. Isolation
2. Concurrency
3. Failure detection
4. Fault identification
5. Live code upgrade
6. Stable storage

* With stable storage you don't need backups. You need snapshots, because you override the data, but you don't need backups.
* Threads are evil because they share resources.
* We already solved the problem with parallel computing (in Erlang). *We are working on detecting bottlenecks now.*

- Expressions condense meaning in space, and eliminate time.
- Understanding occurs only when meaning is selected and simplified enough for a mind to think about it.

## Dave Thomas — Living in Big Data with Vector Functional Programming 

- Slides: [GitHub](https://github.com/strangeloop/lambdajam2013/blob/master/slides/Thomas-LivingInBigDataWithVectorFunctionalProgramming.pdf)

{% blockquote @kaleidic https://twitter.com/kaleidic/statuses/354961117816176642 %}
This is the first time I've been in the audience of a talk on vector languages.
{% endblockquote %}

- Extreme cases — that's what is interesting.
- I don't do Big Data, I don't have a petabyte in my pocket.
- I'm an industrial language pimp.
- I've got 3 characters on the screen and I have no idea what they’re doing.
- What slows languages down is scalars and non-scalars, boxing and unboxing.
- How to learn an array language? Slowly.

{% img center https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BO0b6S-CMAI2CFd.jpg %}

- Pairing is a great way to learn new things.
- Most programs, by 2020, will be queries.
- There are five error messages, they are all irritating.
- WTF (what the function?) error message.
- All IDEs are bad. Intellij is the best of worst.


## Steve Vinoski — Addressing Network Congestion in Riak Clusters

- Video: [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6PG6hkUHPM)

- Riak — A distributed highly available eventually consistent highly scalable open source key-value database written primarily in Erlang, built for operational ease.
- Riak TCP traffic:
1. Client requests: made to any node in the ring
1. Coordination: node receiving client request coordinates the operation across the owning replicas
1. Gossip: Riak nodes share ring state via a gossip protocol
1. Active Anti-Entropy: nodes actively verify and repair data consistency across the ring
1. Erlang: distributed Erlang nodes form a full mesh and do periodic node availability checks
1. Handoff
- TCP incast.
- Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT).
- Micro Transport Protocol (μTP, or uTP).

{% img center https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BO0uyloCAAAS7X4.jpg %}

- Write a project in C++ or Java and you’re creating work for 5 other devs. Write it in Erlang and you’re done.
- There is a special place in hell for the people who came up with the Oauth 2.0 spec.
- Everything is an FSM. Problem with actually modeling this is complexity of large FSMs. Answer is encapsulation.
- Design your system as a big FSM that is a collection of little FSMs. Only transition between them as needed.

## Bonus 1: Joe Armstrong @ CEUG — 26 Years With Erlang

Video: [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCwRGHj5jOE)

- If you are an academic you think to develop a programming language in three or four years because that's the time it takes to get your PhD, then you finish your PhD and the whole world will use it. It doesn't work like that. You got to do quite few other things.
- That's what we did in 1985, before the Internet: we were creating programming languages.
- Version 1.03 lost in the mists of time.
- When Prolog program goes wrong, it says *No*.

{% codeblock lang:prolog %}
uni --->
    case(wait,[
        n => [term,exit],
        h => [hold,
              case(new_call,[
                connected => multi,
                n => case(gone_away,[
                       yes => exit,
                       no => [conv,uni]
                     ]),
                h => [conv,uni]
              ])
             ]
    ]).
{% endcodeblock %}

- This diagrams are nested state machines.
- You do not program the abnormal things, you do not make any decisions about how to program the stuff which is outside of the specification. What you do is you crash your program and let somebody else to resolve the problem and put back all the invariants.
- It took four days to re-write the whole Erlang.
- That's the entire documentation of Erlang 1.05

- Don't speculate about performance. Write the program, run it, and measure it.
- Robert collected the whole pile of papers on how abstract machines worked. I borrowed this file and took it for a weekend, and I read every single paper from beginning to end… and I understood nothing. Then Monday morning I suddenly woke up and I understood it.
- There is no garbage collection in atom table.
- The original Erlang movie was made for ISS 90. And we had script!
- Robert wanted to buy a train set on the money from the lab.
- "Amazing but true! Blindingly fast!"
- 8 Dec 1995, AXE-N cancelled. 1996 AXD 301 started.
- AXD 301 could switch up to 160Gb/sec. For countries of the size of Sweeden you can only sell one. I think British Telecom bought 3 or something. It was great technical success but it didn't earn any money.
- Banning things has interesting consequences. Erlang got open sourced. Four days after Erlang was banned all people who developed it left Ericsson and started their own company Bluetail.
- Now DNA of Erlang is spreading through various companies.


## Bonus 2: Joe Armstrong @ CEUG — Sherlock's Last Case

Video: [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh4tmDB9iQI)

- "How can you be more efficient programmer? By not programming."
- When you program for 20–30 years, the "make it work" challenge is gone away. It's more challenging to think what problem you are going to solve.
- The problem I've been thinking for the last five years is how to organize the data, how to organize ideas.
- Value store is a key-value store without keys. How to get the data out of this database?
- Sherlock's Problem: There is $X$, and there are thousands of $Y_i$. Which $Y_i$ is the nearest to $X$?
- The categorization problem is extremly difficult. That's why object-oriented programming is stupid.
- Concurrency oriented programming is a physical modelling.
- Measures of similarity. TF*IDF.
- Naive Bayesian

$$
P(A|B) P(B) = P(B|A) P(A)
$$

- Normalized compression difference: If $A$ and $B$ are similar then size(compress($A$++$B$) will be wee bit larger than size(compress($A$)). It's insensitive to choice of compression algorithm.
- Idea for IDE: Social programming network. It shows all the people working on the code similar to what you are typing.

### Q & A

- Macros and include files should be removed from the language.
- Maybe atoms should be garbage collected.
- The biggest problem in building technical systems is 'connecting thing together' problem.
- If I need to write a language, it wouldn't be programming language. I would write a protocol description language.
- Principle of observational equivalence.
- [UBF](http://ubf.github.io/ubf/).
- "There are languages that people bitch about, and there are languages that nobody's using." — Bjarne Stroustrup
- Scale change. Petabyte change is enormously interesting.
- We need to make cryptography available to all the people.
- Take the data out of the cloud, and put it into your home clouds.
- NSA will kill Google and Facebook.
