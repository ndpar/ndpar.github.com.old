<p>My name is Andrey Paramonov. On the web I'm also known as ndpar, which, by the way, is pronounced as "aNDy Par".

<p>I live in Toronto, Canada with my beautiful wife and two wonderful kids.

<p>I used to be a professional mathematician and hobbyist programmer, but at some point those two swapped. These days I earn my bread and butter by writing web applicaitons for JVM platform. At my spare time I indulge in functional programming with Erlang and Lisp.

<p>I love learning new stuff, I like asking questions, and somewhere deep inside my heart I remain a mathematician who strives for rigor even in everyday life, which sometimes annoys people around me.

<p>My favourite social network is <a href="https://github.com/ndpar">GitHub</a>. I also use <a href="https://twitter.com/ndpar">Twitter</a>.

<p>If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an email to <em>blog</em> at <em>ndpar.com</em>.
